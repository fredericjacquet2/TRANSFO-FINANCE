### 1. Clear on Saas and the like?

Usual apps run more & more in Saas mode (Software as a service or Cloud app services). 
"Partial" cloudisaiton can also be implemented with Paas (Platform as a sercie) or Iaas (Infrastrucutre as a service). 
See [IaaS, PaaS, SaaS Explained and Compared](https://apprenda.com/library/paas/iaas-paas-saas-explained-compared/)     

*From an accounting perspective, Saas has implications as it shifts CAPEX towards OPEX*

### 2. Clear on what's an ERP ?
ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) = a group of interconnected modules + a database.

[see here for ERP fundamentals](https://www.oracle.com/applications/erp/what-is-erp.html)

[and here for a neat video to summarize the transversal role of an ERP] (https://videos.cdn.sap.com/vod/2017/delivering-on-the-promise.mp4)

### 3. Off-the-shelf products 
A number of "products" handle automatisaiotn of trasnacitonal processes:
- ERP module implementation (SAP, Oracle, MS Dynamicsâ€¦)
- Market-leading specific business applications, taylored to a specific process (e.g. Blackline for accounting)    

*Include and/or can be "leveraged" with specific add-ons (RPA or Dataviz for example)*

### 4. RPA Robotic Process Automation

A robot automates human tasks, it works ideally if : 
- very repetitive tasks
- no intelligence

Number of available softwares availlable to do so, relative ease of configuration. ROI very dependent of repetitivity.

- A 3 minutes, neat & finance related video on an example of RPA implementation = [RPA 3min](https://youtu.be/xW95yb6J1eU)
- Another one in 7 minutes = [RPA 7min](https://youtu.be/loOR-nz9DGY)
- By the way, do you see social issue or social promise in those ?
- OK for reading ? A great tutorial, 20 minutes read : [RPA doc](https://www.guru99.com/robotic-process-automation-tutorial.html)

> Case ARCELOR MITTAL (source Digital Finance Awards 2019)   

- Robotisation of Financial Processes within consolidation & reporting departments : 30 robots for 44 processes
- Excellent results in regards to productivity, performance, deliveralbes quality, time gain
- Led to a real innovation culture & change in mentalities witihn the teams

### 5. Chatbots (WIP)

- Chatbot = a talking robot (imitates human conversations through voice and/or text chats).    
- Chatbot minimizes response time & improves customer experience.    

*History of chatbots dates back to 1966 whit a psychotherapist called ELIZA. You can still converse with it here: [Eliza](http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm?utm_source=ubisend.com&utm_medium=blog-link&utm_campaign=ubisend).*   

----

Very broad complexity of chatbots, two variants
- Rule-Based : bot answers questions based on defined and set rules (rules can be simple to complex!)
- Self learning: bot uses Machine Learning-based approaches. More efficient than rule-based bots.
