## Chapter 3 - Leveraging the Business Partner Finance

----

In this chapter:
- Going **beyond digitalising existing processes**, and moving towards predictive performance management with Machine learning over Big Data & Analytics

----

##### Business Partner Finance : from cost control towards performance management in predictive mode

- A finance function closer to the business ("business partner finance") 
- A finance function closer to technology (IT/ BI / EPM... )
- A finance function Master of the Data
- Predictive rather than reactive

> QUOTE by Accenture (" Finance 2020 ")  

"Finance is doing things that it never could before thanks to digital technologies. The finance organization will evolve from an expense control, spreadsheet-driven accounting and reporting center, into a predictive analytics powerhouse that creates business value. Tomorrow’s digital finance organization deals in analytics and forward-looking decisions to create value and manage risk. It shifts traditional accounting and processing to cross-functional integrated business services models that use robotic process automation. It trades reporting the past for predicting the future."

A two-fold approach for the Business Partner Finance : 
1. Abality to generate taylored made, real-time reporting : BI / EPM tools 
2. Capacity to leverage the "usual" performance management reporting towards predictive performance management : Big Data (Data lake, Data factory) and Analytics (IA, Machine learning)

> **Case example BARILLA (source Digital Finance Awards 2019 & other sources)**     

- Promotional offers optimization : solution called TPO (Trade Promotion Optimization)
- TPO is dedicated to sales & forecasters teams, with responsibility assigned to Finance
- allowed to consolidate Business Partnering
- Development of IA Machine learning models, Big Data & Data analytics
- Result : forecast promotion ROI on innumerous variables (multiple products, dozens of segments, specific stores, time of year).

> Illustration : Online sports betting actor     

- Market : very competitive + strong growth
- Objectives : increase market share and profitability of the sport betting activity
- Specific focus : Customer acquisition cost 
- Initial information : net cost of promotional offers, market share evolution, BU profitability

----

Key questions: 
- What is the impact of the promotional offer on increasing market share? 
- What is the ROI of the promotional offers ?

To provide some answers:
- Understand and differentiate player behaviours and player types according to presnet & future context

----

The project:
- Setting up a project-oriented organization, lead CFO + CDO
- Set-up a Data factory (Data lake)
- set-up analysis algorithms from:
  - Historical data from structured databases (several years of history)
  - Internet player end behaviour recording
  - Unstructured, real time data (social networks, news…) analysis implementation
- Main key analysis: player profile / sport type / timeline

----

Result: 
- Predictive analysis
- Optimization of customer acquisition cost, depending on the context (type of game, games to come)
- Improved sports BU profitability
