### 1. A few stats on where we are on finance transformation

----

> Source : Les Echos Executive, March 2019 (organisations panel 75% large groups / 25% SMEs)

**Organisations having implemented digitalisation projects**
- P2P process (56% of the panel), Data visualisaiton (39%), RPA (30%), R2R (23%)
- Predictive analytics, IA or Blockchain : 4% of the panel (with 18% envisaging a predictive / IA project on a short-medium term)

----

> Source : Les Echos Executive, March 2019 (organisations panel 75% large groups / 25% SMEs)

**Main issues mentioned**
- cultural transformation / change management
- dealing with legacy IT / SW tools compared to new tech
- ressources allocation & competence management      

----

### 2. Key success factors for any digitalisation project

It holds in 3 words: people, processes, tools   

yep, its vast!

----

- **PEOPLE**      
 - Execution team : clear governance (roles, responsibilites, delegation), time allocation, skills, mindset
 - Users / stakeholders : **SEEK ADOPTION** change management / communication / training
 - Stakeholders management : align interests at all levels / deal with politics (internal conflicts)
 - Forecast general resistance to change (indivudual and organisational) and identify organisational & social issue

----

- **PROCESSES** 
  - Are they clear over the whole process (different countries, BUs, teams) ?
  - Are they precise enough (avoid regular human intervention to clarifiy process) ? 
  - A good opportunity to clarify !    

----

- **TOOLS**
  - Avoid "tool first" approach
  - Right tool for the right need : specs, thorough thinking and choice
  - Adapt choice complexity to stake at hand     
  - Market-leading software applications, designed for specific processes and/or broad software products requiring (robots, chabots, data analysis, datavisualisation). All requiring simplified integration (opened, « IT backbone » ERP)

----

### 3. Global or local ?  

- Global digital strategy (look at Michelin) 
- or Short steps / local initiatives / quickwinns 
- Top down or bottom up methodology ?
- Proactive or resisting management ?

Well it all works. But not with the same paste / scale / pleasure !

----

#### Global : a clear vision & plan      

***1. Define the strategic vision (where we want to go)***       
- Build a vision of a target state (objectives and impact)
- A clearly stated vision helps align everyone’s actions     


***2. Engage stakeholders***
- Ensure everyone understands the why
- Secure support and buy-in from stakeholders (board, executives, employees, partners and customers)

----

***3. Ensure proper planning***
- Plan relatively clear tasks and milestones, including quickwins to boost motivation      

***4. Budget for sufficient resources and expertise***
- Internal team with right knowledge, authority, external support

----

> Case example ENGIE Kairos@EngieFinance (source Digital Finance Awards 2019, "most ambitious" category)    

- Global program launched in 2016
- Accross the whole finance function (staff 4800, 70 countries, 24 BUs, Holding and SSCs)
- Accross all processes
- Hard (tools, tehcnology, SAP4Hana convergence)
- Soft around change management

----

#### Local initiatives

A large source of Digital inspiration !

Local initiatives are everywhere (with or without a Global strategy) 

----

> Case example : Managing signature books (parapheurs in French) in a large European group     

- Set-up Docusing software as an internal tool to replace "physical" signature books process   
- Result : improved treasury management / on-time payments

----

#### In an agile world, global can be a sum of local

### 4. Digital transformation : changes in the finance function   

----

#### Digtial changes role & organisation of Corporate finance

- Organisation progressivelly adds Data management capacities 
- Role shifts towards : the business, Data amanagement (data analysts, data scientists), IT management
- More high-added value tasks (analysis, human interactions) and less low-added value tasks : a social issue ?

----

#### Changing roles & new positions in corporate finance     

**New C-suite roles for Finance transformation** : CFTO Chief Financial Technology Officer or Chief Financial Transformation Officer / CFIO Chief Financial Information Officer

> Key slills, by M. Page (CFO baromter)      
- *"Financial must be committed to extending their formal qualifications in the core areas of their work,* 
- *learning new methods and technologies such as data analytics, and* 
- *improving their social, communication and change management competences."*

#### What is at stake for the finance funciton ? 

- Having Finance to become the digital leader or to loose its central role on numbers ? 

As digital remove silos, could there be a competition between Finance, IT and Marketing to become the leading funciton of the company?     
[see video : vision of 2 predicitve scenarios by Deloitte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU2zyRKKZ5g)

##### Finance evolution = « business partner » or Expert ? An existential challenge ?  

----

### 5. WIIFM (What's in it for me) ? 

- Is my present job/role impacted by those initiatves, good or bad news ?
- How is digital considered within the organisation, does/could it create value to the Finance team ?
- Does/could it create value to my personal profile ?    

#### An annoyance or a hobby, a side-duty or a full time job ?
